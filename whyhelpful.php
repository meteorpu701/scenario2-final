                <p>Hypnosis, proven to enhance medicinal therapy, can boost the efficacy of treatments during a trance state.
                 This heightened receptiveness enables faster recovery from illnesses or medical procedures. 
                 Integrating hypnosis into the NHS app offers a cost-effective solution, 
                 reducing resource consumption and easing the burden on the Public Health Service. 
                 With approximately 90% of the population responsive to hypnosis, patients could utilize the platform before appointments,
                  optimizing treatment outcomes. </p>

                <p>We propose the implementation of carefully curated hypnotherapy videos (by trance-form medical) 
                within the NHS to help streamline resource usage, including medicine and time, 
                and facilitate a more efficient NHS operation. Additionally, patients can access hypnotherapy videos for home use, 
                promoting accelerated recovery and disease control without excessive medication.This approach improves patient 
                outcomes and also enables the reallocation of funds for other areas of the healthcare sector like Research and 
                Development or other under funded branches. </p>
